description: Your tools for the boring stuff

As a developer, you are faced with a wide variety of tasks and problems every day. It shouldn't be complicated to create the latest changelog or anything similar. 

That's why we have made it our mission to provide the best tools to make the developer's job easier. To make sure that we take the right path with the tools, we have decided to make all code publicly available.

This also ensures that anyone who wants to can run the tools themselves and thus have full control over the data. In addition, anyone can contribute to the code and have a say in the direction of the project.
