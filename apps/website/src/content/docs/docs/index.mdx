description: Your tools for the boring stuff

boring.tools is a collection of tools for developers to make your day easier.

By boring tools we don't mean that they are insignificant or unimportant. Just that many of the important tools are not exciting but have to do their job perfectly.

However, we want to make the boring tools as attractive as possible so that they are fun to use. Furthermore, it is very important to us that the tools do as much work as possible for the developer.
